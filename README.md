# **Object Sorting Using Robotic arm and Image processing**
Abstract :- 


1.The object should be placed at a **between the clamp in front of the camera which will be be sorted depending upon the color of the object (red,blue and green *can add more colors*). The robotic arm will place them at three different angles at 90,180 and 270 degrees**. The images will be processed by raspberry pi using opencv and the robotic arm will be controlled by arduino board due to its simplicity. 


2.Raspberry pi will detect the color by performing various operations on the images captured and will determine the color of the object. 


3.After the color is detected ,**rpi will send the information to arduino using 2 bits (10,01,11), 1 is high and 0 is low usimg gpio pins** of raspberry pi


4.The two wires will be connected from gpio pins of rpi to two digital pins of arduino using simple jumper wires(No UART or other communication bus is used instead two simple wires which will either be high or low.


5.The robotic arm will perform operation depending upon the color.


6.Arduino will control three servo motors and motor control clamp. 



  
**HARDWARES USED:**


1.RASPBERRY PI 2


2.ARDUINO UNO


3,USB CAMERA


4.MOTOR CONTROL I.C. (For clamp in robotic hand)


5.Three SERVO MOTORS




**SOFTWARES USED:**


1.PYTHON


2.OPENCV


3.ARDUINO IDE


4.NUMPY



**How to run these codes..?**


1.Run classmoto.ino in arduino board which controls two servo motors and a dc motor.


2.Run colordetect.py on raspberry with a USB camera.


3.Connect two wires from rpi to arduino to send the commands and another wire for ground.
